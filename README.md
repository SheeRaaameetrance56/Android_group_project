Splendy is an Android app that allows easier event management and connectivity. The app focused on two main parties attending the event: event organizers and attendees.

Splendy mobile app serves as a transformative solution to the 
challenges entrenched in traditional event management. 
For organizers, Splendy streamlines the event management process, offering features for 
creating, scheduling, managing, promoting, choosing the expected audiences, and efficiently 
communicating event details. Furthermore, the application facilitates timely notifications to 
participants, thereby eliminating confusion and enhancing overall event coordination.
Participants, on the other hand, benefit from a user-friendly interface that simplifies the 
discovery of events tailored to their interests. The app centralizes event information, providing 
participants with easy access to details, schedules, and any updates. The categorization of events 
as public or private ensures selective participation in private events, offering a personalized and 
secure experience. Moreover, the facility to contact through chats with the organizers will assist in 
resolving and clarifying any issues related with miscommunication of event information.
